It's all under construction...

Usage
The python folder contains all the python files needed to produce the z80 assembly output. A this point there are two ways to use it:
- if you are into Eclipse, you can set up a python environment, the output is produced to a file or to the console. From there you can take the code to your ZX Spectrum compiler/emulator of choice.
- if not, you can still work with it. A batch file runs the python compliler, compiles the z80 assembly output and runs the image in Fuse (i have not tested this method lately, but I will).

Files
(note that .asc stands for assemply libraries that can be included in the general code)

config.py      general configuration files, mostly stuffed with global variables
graph.asc      assembly library for ZX Spectrum graphics
input.js       input file with source javaScript code
io.asc         assembly library for ZX Spectrum I/O
main.py        >>> main python program. the one you need to run
math.asc       assembly library for math
output.asm     output file containing result of compilation
testplan.js    test plan with main features, used for non-regression tests
translator.py  >>> here is the meat. all the translation process is done here.
